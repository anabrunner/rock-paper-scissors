# Rock Paper Scissors

This is a simple implementation of the classic children's game of "rock paper scissors" that can be played from the browser against the computer.

The purpose of this project was to practice using JavaScript to create functions for the game's logic and to manipulate the DOM. The design of the page is simple, and uses CSS Flexbox to be responsive for mobile or different size screens.
